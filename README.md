### File Server

Client and Server to serve a website that creates a user-based file server.

React/Redux frontend, to serve a simple webpage, and a Java JAX-RS based 
REST interface to serve the content and run on the local machine. 

Current testing uses apache to deploy on local computer and service. 

Essentially this will be a privatized Google Drive / Dropbox replacement 
that can run on a local server and act as a backup of important content. 

The details are TBD, but looking for the following functionality:
* Browse files
* Download files
* Upload files
* Preview files / thumbnail / in-browser viewing experience. 
* User-specific access rights
* File sharing
* More to come as I think of them :)
