Just a summary of things that are TODO (Not features, but more tech debts)

* Have appropriate error handling on all the server requests that were created earlier. 
* Have proper routing for error messages on client-side as well.
* Authorization roles
* Modify how thumbnails are created/returned - (create once?)
* Probably clean up and redo most of the old redux paths. The patterns are all over the place in terms of style lmfao.
